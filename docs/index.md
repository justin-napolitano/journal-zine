# Journal Zine Knowledge Base

Welcome! This mini knowledge base lives alongside the codebase so Codex (and humans) can grab architecture context quickly. Use the sidebar to jump into:

- **Architecture** for system diagrams and object reference
- **Auth & Sessions** to debug cookie issues
- **Mastodon** for import/cross-post behavior
- **Frontend & Layout** to understand component props
- **Dev & Ops** for setup, cron endpoints, and migrations

If you're reading this via `mkdocs serve`, the five sections above appear in the navigation because `mkdocs.yml` pins them explicitly. Feel free to expand the nav with new files as the project grows.
